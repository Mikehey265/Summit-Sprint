# Summit-Sprint
After 4 weeks of collaborating within a team of 16 very talented people, I am proud to present our accomplishment. Summit Sprint is a high-octane rock climbing game. As a climber, your objective is to reach the peak of the mountains as fast as possible. Climb and jump among rocks, manage to get enough chalk and not to fall from the cliff. </br>

## General info

Our objective was to develop a mobile game centered around the theme of extreme sports. After making some research, we went with extreme climbing as our project, as we noticed a notable lack of realistic yet arcade-style climbing games in the mobile games market. <br><br>
The game was designed for mobile devices with intuitive interaction for players. It is accessible and easy to learn, yet demands the skills of a pro gamer to truly master. Summit Sprint features a tutorial level along with three very well designed levels. Players can try to beat their own high scores, race against their personal best ghost, and try to complete a set of side objectives that unlock developer ghost to race with for an additional challege. Additionally, we implemented a chalk functionality that requires players to manage their chalk level to prevent from falling.

## Controls
* Slide on the left/right half of the screen to control the left/right hand of the climber to grab on rocks.
* Touch the climber to decide the direction of the jump, and release to jump. Remember to touch the screen to grab a rock after jumping, otherwise you can fall.

## My contribution
In this project, one of my responsibilities was to create and manage a game manager. Its primary function was to integrate everyone's work into a fully functional game. I created various game states to facilitate easier control of the game's behavior across different phases. Thanks to this solution it was very easy to come back and add additional functionalities to specific states.<br><br>
I was also responsible for creating saving system, score manager and side objectives. Ensuring that player scores persisted between sessions was a top priority for us. To achieve this, I implemented an efficient saving system using JSON files, which functioned precisely as we wanted. The score system was time-based, making it relatively straightforward. Players were rewarded with gold, silver, or bronze medals depending on whether they completed the level within the specified time. Implementing side objectives was a late addition to our project, as we were closing to our deadline. Despite the time constraints, I utilized scriptable objects to streamline the process, allowing designers to easily modify the side objectives to suit their needs. I successfully developed fully functional side objectives manager, enriching our game with yet another exciting feature. At the end I integrated side objectives, current time, best time, medals etc. into our UI, ensuring that players could easily view and track their progress during gameplay.<br><br>
